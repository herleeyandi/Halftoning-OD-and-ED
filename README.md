# Halftoning-OD-and-ED

This implementation run in python. Everything implemented manually.
You can run the Ordered dithering algorithm from ODmain.py which implementing Classical4 and Bayer5 array. While for the Error difussion you can see on EDmain.py.

#Warning

This implementation still using manual convolution in Python loops. so it will be too slow compared with other method.
However Convolution just used on testing image using HPSNR.
